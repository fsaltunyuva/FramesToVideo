# Frames to Video

Video generator for renders created from [my ray tracer](https://github.com/fsaltunyuva/RayTracer).

## Prerequisites
Before running this script, please make sure FFmpeg is installed. If it is not, download from [ffmpeg.org](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) and make sure the FFmpeg executable is located at `C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe`.

## Usage
Create a folder named renders in the same directory as the script and place all .png image frames inside this folder.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The images should be named in a way that allows correct alphabetical ordering (e.g., frame_001.png, frame_002.png, etc.).
